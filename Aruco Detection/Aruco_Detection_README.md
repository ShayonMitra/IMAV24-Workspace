Use your own webcam's calibration data
Note that two check files are present which work in different versions
if simple check.py doesn't work then use the function from check_lab_pc.py for EstimatePoseMarkers and make the necssary changes
The check_lab_pc.py also contains necessary code to run an exterior camera, so be careful while using it
